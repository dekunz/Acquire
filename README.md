## General Introduction
The stock market is a highly complex and dynamic system, that can hardly be predicted or described by a mathematical model. We decided to take a step back and figure out if there is a more simple way to investigate individual aspects of the stock market. We chose to implement the board game Acquire since it is an investment game that includes several aspects that are very important when trying to examine the stock market. The game is played by four players creating, enlarging and merging hotels as well as trading stock. This led to the idea of comparing different strategies and finding the most successful one.
\\\\One of our main objectives was the determine whether or not a conservative strategy is more successful than an offensive strategy. We also wanted to compare a player that invests in small hotels with a player that prefers large hotels. Our last goal was to find out the most successful strategy that we wanted to determine by creating a player that adapts it's strategy.
